The embryos are incubated at 38.5°C for five days. At the end of this  \\nincubation period, eggs which show living embryos are selected for the  \\npreparation of the vaccine. The viscera of the chicks are harvested, care being  \\ntaken to reject of gizzard and gall bladders. The material is homogenised in a  \\nblender with adequate quantities of antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin  \\nadded if necessary), and primary freeze dried done. This freeze dried material is  \\nground into a fine powder, ampouled in suitable quantities and finally subjected  \\nto secondary freeze drying and sealed under vacuum.4.

Preparation \\n—Smooth strain of  \\nBrucella abortus \\n strain 99 is grown on  \\npotato infusion agar for 48 to 72 hours in Roux flasks, at 37°C. Condensation  \\nfluid if any is pipetted off before washing. Each flask is washed with about 20  \\nml. of normal saline. The pooled washing is filtered through a gauze and the  \\nfiltrate is collected in a measuring cylinder. To every 500 ml. of the filtrate lg.  \\nof 2, 3, 5, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride is added immediately. The container is  \\nshaken for thirty minutes till the tetrazolium salt is dissolved. The product is  \\ntaken out and kept in at 37°C for two hours. After incubation the product is  \\nheated at 65°C in a water bath for thirty minutes. It is cooled and centrifuged at  \\n3000 r.p.m for one hour. The supernatant is pipetted off and sediment is  \\nsuspended in normal saline containing 1 per cent glycerol and 1 per cent phenol  \\nand filtered through sterile cotton wool. This forms concentrated antigen.  \\nSTANDARDIZATION OF THE STRAINED ANTIGEN \\n  \\nAn  \\naliquot  \\nportion  \\nof  \\nthe  \\nmicrobial  \\nsuspension  \\nstained  \\nwith  \\nphenyltetrazolium is taken, representing the initial undiluted suspension. 1 ml.  \\nper tube of this initial undiluted stained suspension is added to six test tubes,  \\nfollowed by increasing quantities of the glycerolphenol diluent as follows:—  \\nTube  \\nUndiluted Stained Suspension  \\nDiluent  \\n1  \\n1  \\n0.6  \\n2  \\n1  \\n0.8  \\n3  \\n1  \\n1.0  \\n4  \\n1  \\n1.2  \\n5  \\n1  \\n1.46  \\n1  \\n1.6  \\n  \\nThe contents of each tube are then diluted tenfold with the same diluent and  \\nserve as antigen for a tube agglutination test with the Standard Serum (or its  \\nnational counterpart). In this way, six seroreactions will be carried out. During  \\nthis procedure, the concentrated strained microbial suspension should be kept in  \\nthe refrigerator at 4°C.  \\nThe agglutination reactions are read after forty-eight hours at the  \\nagglutination titre of the Standard Serum, previously determined with the usual  \\nunstained antigen in the test tube, corresponds to the correct dilution of the  \\nstandard antigen.  \\nThe next step, therefore, is to dilute the concentrated stained suspension to  \\nthe same extent as the tube whose tenfold dilution has given the correct  \\nagglutination titre  \\ni.e., \\n the concentration of antigen in the tube before the tenfold  \\ndilution had been made.  \\n4.    Standards—  \\n(a)     \\nDescription \\n—It is red colour liquid containing dead bacteria in  \\nsuspension.  \\n(b)     \\nIdentification \\n—It shows formation of a specific cherry red coloured  \\nring in the cream layer when mixed with pooled samples of milk taken  \\nfrom animals suffering from brucellosis.  \\n(c)     \\nSterility Test \\n—Should comply with the tests for sterility described in  \\nthe general monograph of \\'Diagnostic Antigen\\'.

The fabric shall be reasonably free  \\nfrom holes, slubs, snarls and naps as well as the following:—  \\nOdour \\n—Misty odour, or any objectionable smell like that of chemicals or  \\nmaterials used in sizing and bleaching.Skewness \\n—(For Bandage Cloth only). A condition where warp and weft do  \\nnot keep at right angles to each other.  \\nDefective selvedge \\n—The selvedge tearing and allowing yam to unravel, and  \\nloop formation at selvedge.  \\nCrack \\n—Prominent streaks of space or gaps between warp or weft yarns.  \\nDouble ends \\n—More warp threads woven as one, due to wrong draw.  \\nSloughing \\n—Entanglement in the fabric of a bulk of yarn that has slipped off  \\nthe weft yam due to loose widing.  \\nMeasurement to length and width \\n—Length is the distance from end to  \\nend, along one edge of the fabric, and width is the perpendicular distance from  \\none edge to the opposite edge.  \\nLength \\n—Fix a metre scale to a table or mark off the division of one metre on  \\na table edge. Starting from one end, spread the fabric flat on that table in a  \\nsingle layer keeping one selvedge parallel to the scale; smoothcn the fabric  \\nwithout stretching it, to avoid creases, and mark off with a coloured pencil, on  \\nthe selvedge exactly one metre. Shift the fabric and measure in the same way  \\nthe second mete and so on for the entire length of the fabric making a mark at  \\neach metre. Note down the total length in metres. Repeat this at the opposite  \\nselvedge, as well as on the fabric folded approximately about middle. The  \\naverage of the three readings is the length. For cut bandages, one measurement  \\nat the middle of the bandage by folding it length-wise will suffice.  \\nWidth \\n—Lay the portion of the fabric to be measured flat and smooth on  \\ntable, but do not stretch fabric except sufficiently to render it creaseless. At the  \\nplace where mark had been made on the selvedge in measuring the length  \\nmeasure the perpendicular distance to the opposite selvedge with a metre scale.  \\nNote the width, repeat this at every mark made in measuring the length. The  \\naverage of all the readings is the width of the fabric. For cut bandages, width  \\nshall be measured at every 50 cm., and average reported as width.  \\nThreads per dm \\n—(For samples not less than 15 m. in Length.)  \\nWeft \\n—At the third metre from one extreme locate three places one at about  \\n5 cm. below the top selvedge, a second in the middle and third at about 5 cm.above the bottom selvedge, all three in a vertical row. Take a rectangular plate  \\n(made of suitable material such as plastic or aluminium) with the rectangular  \\nopening of 5 cm. x 10 cm. cut in it. Keep the plate on the fabric horizontally so  \\nthat the left 5 cm. side and bottom (10 cm. side) edges of the opening coincides  \\nwith a weft and warp yarn respectively; count the number of weft yams within  \\nthe opening for the length of 10 cm. Repeat this at the other two selected places,  \\nand note down the average of three readings. Repeat this at every third metre in  \\nthe sample and calculate the average weft per dm.  \\nWarp \\n—Keep the rectangular plate, this time vertically with left (10 cm.  \\nside) and bottom (5 cm. side) edge of opening coinciding with a weft and warp  \\nyam respectively. Count the number of warp yams within the opening for 10  \\ncm. and note down. Repeat this for about 10 selected places in the samples  \\ntaking care that the same set of warp yarns is not counted more than twice and  \\ncalculate the average warp per dm. Magnifying glass mounted on stand may be  \\nused for counting.  \\nFor samples less than 15 m. in length, locate as many different places as the  \\ndimension of the fabric permits, the total being not less than 10 for each sample,  \\nand calculate the warp and weft per dm. as above.  \\nFor cut bandages, all the warp threads in the samples are counted, taking  \\ncare to leave 5 mm. at the cut edge, and weft is counted at every 50 cm. at any  \\nplace about the middle of the bandage.  \\nWeight per unit area \\n—For samples not less than 15 m. in length, cut out  \\npieces of fabric from the entire length of the sample, representative places being  \\ntaken from areas at every third or fourth metre so that the total area of all the  \\npieces so collected is not less than 3 sq. metre. Weight the pieces accurately,  \\nmeasure the dimension of each of the pieces and calculate the area and weight  \\nof all the pieces. From the average area and average of weight thus obtained,  \\ncalculate the area per sq. metre.  \\nFor samples less than 15 m. in length, take pieces in such manner that the  \\ntotal area of the selected pieces is not less than 20 per cent of the total area of  \\nthe sampleFor cut bandages, pieces of 50 cm. in length, cut from 5 different cut  \\nbandages in a packing should be taken and weight calculated as an average of 5  \\nreadings.  \\nAbsorbency \\n—Take a glass trough of approximate size length 30 cm. x  \\nwidth 30 cm x depth 25 cm. with straight thick walls and flat bottom. Fill it  \\nalmost full with distilled water leaving only about 5 cm. from the top rim of  \\ntrough. Maintain the water at 27 \\n\\n’C ± 1°C.  \\nCut out from any five places located equidistant down the length of the  \\nentire sample, square pieces, each weighing one gm. (+ 10 per cent). For each  \\npiece in such a manner that a square of approximately 5 cm. x 5 cm. is obtained.  \\nKeep one of the folded test specimen between two glass plates and place 1 kg.  \\nweight on the top for 10 minutes. Remove the weight. Lift the specimen with  \\nforceps and gently place it on the surface of water (the specimen should be  \\nlightly pinched in the middle with the blunt forceps having no serrations). As  \\nsoon as the specimen touches the water surface start a stop watch which is  \\nstopped when the entire sample disappears below the surface of the water.  \\nRecord the time taken. Repeat the test with the other four-test specimens.  \\nCalculate the average time in seconds.  \\nForeign Matter \\n—Dry about 5 g. of the sample to constant weight at 105°C  \\nand weight the dried sample accurately. Extract the dried sample with  \\nchloroform for one hour in an apparatus for the continuous extraction of drugs.  \\nRemove the extracted sample to a beaker and allow the evaporation of residual  \\nchloroform. Wash the material 12 times with hot water, using about 1000 ml.  \\nfor each washing and wringing the material by hand after each washing; pass all  \\nwater through a fine sieve (100 mesh.). Place the washed material and any loose  \\nthreads or fibres from the sieve in a beaker, cover with a 0.5 per cent aqueous  \\nsolution of diastase and maintain at 50°C until free from starch. Allow to cool,  \\nfilter the solution through a sieve; return sample and loose fibres to a beaker.  \\nRepeat the washing process as before with hot water. Dry the material to  \\nconstant weight at 105°C, and determine the loss in weight. Calculate the  \\npercentage of foreign matter, which is equal to the loss in weight, with reference  \\nto the sample dried to constant weight, at 105°C.If the sample is tested with iodine and is known to be free from starch, the  \\ntreatment with solution of diastase and the second series of washing with hot  \\nwater may be  \\nomitted. \\n  \\nCloth for manufacture of Plaster of Paris Bandages, cut and uncut  \\nSynonyms: Bleached Bandage Cloth for Plaster of Paris, Rolled Bandage for  \\nPlaster of Paris.  \\nCloth for Plaster of Paris Bandages shall consist of cotton cloth of leno  \\nweave made from yarn of suitable count.

They may be supplied rolled and shall be free from  \\ntackiness and shall be capable of being unrolled readily.  \\n2.    Materials \\n— \\n(1)  \\nCondoms shall be manufactured from good quality  \\nrubber latex and shall be free from embedded grit and shall be opaque or  \\ntranslucent prior to the application of dusting materials or lubricants;  \\n(2) The rubber latex, colours used and any dusting materials or lubricants  \\napplied to the condoms shall neither contain nor liberate substances which are  \\nknown to have toxic or other harmful effects under normal conditions of vise.  \\nAny dusting material or lubricant or colour used shall not have deleterious  \\neffect on the condoms or be harmful to the users.  \\n3. \\n     \\nProcedure for sampling during production \\n—(1) Specimens  \\nconstituting the test samples shall be taken at random successively from each  \\nquantum of production that is, from the quantity produced from the same  \\nfinished rubber latex and under the same processing and finishing conditions of  \\nmanufacture and samples from each quantum shall be tested separately to  \\nascertain conformity of quantum with the specified requirements in accordance  \\nwith the tests described in this Schedule.  \\n(2) (a) The number of samples drawn from each quantum shall not be less  \\nthan 0.5 per cent of the number.  \\n(b) The number of samples drawn from each quantum shall be tested for  \\nBurst Volume and Pressure Test and Water Leakage Test in accordance with the  \\nmethod prescribed in paras 9 and 10 of this Schedule; 75 per cent of the samplesdrawn will be tested for Water Leakage Test and 25 per cent will be tested for  \\nBurst Volume and Pressure Test;  \\n(c) The number of test samples \\'N\\' and the number of rejected samples \\'R\\'  \\nfrom a sequence of production quanta shall be recorded in a register. The  \\ncumulative total of test samples \\'N\\' and the cumulative total of rejects \\'R\\' from  \\nthe test shall be recorded and the condoms shall be deemed to comply with the  \\nrequirements if the cumulative total of rejects \\'R\\' is not more than  \\n\\n[0.0025N  \\n+ 3 x √0.0025N] for Water Leakage Test, and  \\n\\n[0.01N + 3 x √0.015N] for  \\nBurst Volume and Pressure Test.  \\n(3)    Each unit of 100 test samples shall be distributed for the various tests  \\nas follows:—  \\n25 for Burst Volume Pressure Test, and;  \\n75 for Water Leakage Test.  \\n(4)    Where the number of test samples is a multiple of 100 the distribution  \\nscale mentioned above shall be prorated.  \\n(5)    If the cumulative total of samples rejected exceeds the number of  \\nallowables at any point in the sequence of quanta, the quantum at which this  \\noccurs shall be liable to rejection. The assessment of quality of further  \\nproduction quanta shall include all previous test results starting from Quantum  \\nNumber 1 and approval of production shall be in suspense until the condition  \\nrequired by the scheme is again fulfilled.  \\n(6)    At least one sample shall be taken at random from each production  \\nquantum not exceeding 10,000 condoms and shall satisfy all requirements  \\nregarding dimensions as specified in paragraph 8 of this Schedule.  \\n4. Procedure for sampling and testing of finished products by a  \\nmanufacturer. \\n—(A)  \\nWater Leakage Test \\n—(1) Statistical sampling for quality  \\ncontrol assessment of the finished product in respect of water leakage test shall  \\nbe done in accordance with the plant set out in Annexure I to this Schedule.  \\n(2) A test sample failing in the above test is to be considered as defective. If  \\nthe cumulative total of rejects \\'R\\' is found to be equal to or greater than thenumber shown against \\'R\\' in Annexure-I, the batch or lot shall be declared as  \\nnot of standard quality.  \\n(B)  \\nBursting Volume and Pressure Test \\n—(1) Sample condoms shall be  \\ntested for Bursting Volume and Pressure Test.

SUPPLEMENTARY GUIDELINES FOR MANUFACTURING OF  \\nRASAUSHADHIES OR RASAMARUNTHUKAL AND KUSHTAJAT  \\n(HERBO-MINERAL-METALLIC COMPOUNDS) OF AYURVEDA,  \\nSIDDHA AND UNANI MEDICINES \\n  \\nThese guidelines are intended to complement those provided above and  \\nshould be read in conjunction with the parent guidelines. The  \\nsupplementan/  \\nguidelines are \\n to provide general and minimum technical requirements for  \\nquality  \\nassurance  \\nand  \\ncontrol  \\nin  \\nmanufacturing  \\nRasaushadhis  \\nor  \\nRasamarunthukal and Kushtajat (Herbo-mineral-metallic formulations). These  \\nsupplementary guidelines deal with Bhasmas, Sindura, Pishti, Kajjali, Khalviya  \\nRas, Kupipakwa, Rasayan, Parpati, Potali Rasa, Satwa (of Metals and Minerals  \\norigin) Druti Parpam, Karpu, and Kushta etc. used in Ayurvedic, Siddha and  \\nUaani Systems of medicine.  \\nThe supplementary GMP guidelines for Rasaushadhi or Rasamarunthukal  \\nand Kushtajat are needed to establish the authenticity of raw drug, minerals and  \\nmetals, in-process validation and quality control parameters to ensure that these  \\nformulation are processed and prepared in accordance with classical texts and  \\nfor which safety measures are complied. Only those manufacturing units which  \\nhave Good Manufacturing Practices for ASU drugs and supplementarycertificate of Rasaushadhies or Rasamarunthukal and Kushtajat formulations  \\nshall be allowed to manufacture the same. Supplementary Good Manufacturing  \\nPractices certificate for Rasaushadhies shall be issued by the State Licensing  \\nAuthority only after thorough inspection by an expert team including Rasashstra  \\nexperts nominated by the Department of AYUSH.  \\n2. Manufacturing Process Areas.— \\nFor the manufacture of Bhasma and  \\nKupipakawa and Rasaushadhi preparations made from metals and minerals the  \\nfollowing specific areas shall be provided, which should be completely  \\nsegregated from the production area used for preparation of plants and animal  \\nbyproduct based formulation to avoid cross-contamination. The following  \\nexclusive areas are required for Rasaushadhies or Rasamarunthukal and  \\nKushtajat:—  \\n2.2. (a)  \\nBhatti or Heating Devise section for Bhasma and Rasaushadhies. \\n— \\n100 Sq. feet for heating, burning, putta and any heat related work with proper  \\nventilation, exhaust and chimney. This could be tin shed also.  \\n(b)     \\nGrinding, Drying and Processing section for Bhasma and  \\nRasaushadhies. \\n—100 Sq. feet (Manual or Mechanical, oven etc.). Drying  \\n\\n  \\n[shall be] done in a space which is covered by glass or other transparent  \\nmaterial to allow entry of sunrays on the material to keep for the purpose. If  \\ndrying is being done in oven the temperature of the same may be selected  \\nspecific temperature.  \\n(c)     \\nRashaushadi Related Store. \\n—100 Sq. feet.  \\nThe size and dimensions of each Bhatti section would be so designed to suit  \\nthe batch size or quantity of materials to be processed, keeping in mind the  \\nprocessing is done as per the conditions of Drug and Cosmetics Act mentioned  \\nunder Schedule I official books.  \\nIn addition to the fuels prescribed in the schedule books namely coal, fire  \\nwood, cow dung cakes etc., use of other heating devices  \\ne.g., \\n electrical heating,  \\noil or gas fired furnaces and others  \\n\\n[shall be] employed so as to provide the  \\nrequired temperature as per the nature of material and object of heating.  \\nDepending on the formulation being manufactured, manufacturers may adopt  \\naerobic or anaerobic process. Properly baked and clean earthen pots of other  \\ncrucibles and glass containers or appropriate design shall be used.The manufacturing area should be designed with special attention to process  \\nthe products that generate toxic fumes like S0 \\n\\n arsenic and mercury vapour, etc.  \\nWhen heating and boiling of the materials is necessary, suitable ventilation and  \\nair exhaust flow mechanism should be provided to prevent accumulation of  \\nunintended fumes and vapours. Such areas may be provided with properly  \\ndesigned chimneys or ducts fitted with exhaust system and suitable scrubbing  \\nsystem to remove fumes and smoke, so that safety of personnel and  \\nenvironment is taken care of.  \\nSince processing of Rasaushadhis may introduce heavy metal contamination  \\nand cross-contamination etc., therefore, cleaning of equipment is particularly  \\nimportant after every process by using appropriate cleaning agent which should  \\nnot react with material of equipment and must be free from unwanted properties  \\ne.g., \\n corrosiveness.  \\n2.3 Records shall be maintained specially for temperatures attained during  \\nthe entire process of Bhasmikaran, while employing different kinds of classical  \\nputa, furnaces using oil, gas or electricity. Appropriate temperature measuring  \\ninstrument should be employed such as pyrometer and, pyrograph for manual  \\nreading or recording by heat sensors, connected to computer as the case may be.  \\nIn order to handle large quantities, appropriate technology like use of hand  \\noperated extruders for making chakrikas or pellets may be adopted. However,  \\nsuch equipments made of aluminium or its alloys should not be used.  \\nAccess to manufacturing areas shall be restricted to minimum number of  \\nauthorized personal only.  \\n3.

Weight of Rasaushadhi in each unit.B. Product Quality Control: \\n  \\nThe specifications for finished Rasaushadhi are primarily intended to define  \\nthe quality rather than to establish full characterization, and should focus on  \\nthose characteristics found to be useful in ensuring the quality. Consistent  \\nquality for Rasaushdhi can only be assured if the starting material-metals and  \\nminerals are used of pharmacopoeial standards. In some cases more detailed  \\ninformation may be needed on aspects of their process. The manufacture will  \\nensure in-house standards for the uniform quality of product.  \\nQuality testing will be carried out as per official Pharmacopoeia or Schedule  \\nbooks for texts namely, colour, taste, varitaratwa, Rekhapurnatwa, Laghutva,  \\nNirdhumatwa,  \\nDutagre  \\nKachakacha,  \\nNiruttha,  \\nApunarbhava  \\nand  \\nNischandratwa.  \\nThe Particle size of the product should be tested by adopting microscope  \\nfitted with micrometer or particle size analyzer or any appropriate other  \\ntechniques. Required physio-chemical characterization of the product should be  \\nundertaken by appropriate analytical equipment. The Standard Manufacturing  \\nProcess of the product should be evolved/ follow up. The disintegration time of  \\npills-vati and tablets should also be recorded.  \\n4.    Product recalls.— \\nLiterature inserted inside the product package should  \\nindicate the name address of the manufacturing unit  \\n\\n[and] telephone number  \\nfor reporting of any adverse drug reaction by physicians or patients. On receipt  \\nof such Adverse Drug Reaction report, it will be the responsibility of the  \\nmanufacturer to ensure the recall the product from the market.  \\nStandard operating procedures (SOP) should be included for storage of  \\nrecalled Rasaushadhies in a secure segregated area, complying with the  \\nrequirements specified for storage, till their final disposal.  \\n5.    Medical examination of the employees.— \\nEmployees engaged in  \\nmanufacturing should be medically examined periodically at least once a year  \\nfor any adverse effect of the drug during manufacturing process for which  \\nnecessary investigations  \\n\\n[shall be] carried out for ensuring that there is no  \\neffect of material on the vital organs of the employees. Annual examination  \\nreports of the employees shall be made available to statutory inspectors during  \\nGood Manufacturing Practices inspections.6.    Self-Inspection.— \\nThe release of Rasaushadhis should be under the  \\ncontrol of a person who has been trained in the specific features of the  \\nprocessing and quality assurance of Rasaushadhis. Personnel dealing with the  \\nproduction and quality assurance of Rasaushadhis manufacturing section should  \\nhave an adequate training in the specific subject of Rasaushadhis  \\nmanufacturing. He will be at least a degree holder in Ayurveda/ Siddha/Unani  \\nmedicine or B. Pharma degree holder in Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani medicine.  \\n7.    Dosage form of Rasaushadhi.— \\nThe Rasaushadhies may be made into  \\nan acceptable dosage forms such as, churna, vati, guti, tablet, capsule or  \\nCapsule etc., after adding suitable permissible fillers or binding agents as  \\npermissible under the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India or Indian  \\nPharmacopoiea as updated from time to time. In such cases the label must  \\nindicate the quantity of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicine in one Tablet or  \\nPill or Capsule in addition to the filler. The crystalline product may be grinded  \\nbefore packing in the individual dispensing size\". All the Rasushadhi or  \\nRasamaruthukal or Kushtajat shall be packed in a dosage form which is ready  \\nfor use for the consumer.

Standard  \\noperating procedures are required to be documented by the  \\ninvestigate 3 for the tasks performed by them. During and following  \\na subject\\'s participation in a trial, the investigator should ensure that  \\nadequate medical care is provided to the participant for any adverse  \\nevents. Investigator(s) shall report all serious and unexpected  \\nadverse events to the  \\n\\n[Licensing Authority defined under clause  \\n(b) of rule 21, the Sponsor or his representative, whosoever had  \\nobtained permission from the Licensing Authority for conduct of the  \\nclinical trial, and the Ethics Committee that accorded approval to the  \\nstudy protocol, within twenty four hours of their occurrence.  \\n\\n[In  \\ncase, the Investigator fails to report any serious adverse event within  \\nthe stipulated period, he shall have to furnish tne reason for the delay  \\nto the satisfaction of the Licensing Authority along with the report of  \\nthe serious adverse event. The report of the serious adverse event,  \\nafter due analysis, shall be forwarded by the Investigator to the  \\nLicensing Authority as referred to in clause (b) of rule 21, the  \\nChairman of the Ethics Committee and the Head of the institution  \\nwhere the trial has been conducted within fourteen days of the  \\noccurrence of the serious adverse event.]].  \\n\\n[(ii) The Investigator shall provide information to the clinical trial  \\nsubject through informed consent process as provided in Appendix  \\nV about the essential elements of the clinical trial and the subject\\'s  \\nright to claim compensation in case of trial related injury or death.  \\nHe shall also inform the subject or his/her nominee(s) of their rights  \\nto contact the Sponsor or his representative whosoever had obtained  \\npermission from the Licensing Authority for conduct of the clinicaltrial for the purpose of making claims in the case of trial related  \\ninjury or death.]  \\n(4)  \\nInformed Consent \\n—  \\n(i)    In all trials, a freely given, informed, written consent is required to  \\nbe obtained from each study subject. The Investigator must provide  \\ninformation about the study verbally as well as using a patient  \\ninformation sheet, in a language that is non-technical and  \\nunderstandable by the study subject. The subject\\'s consent must be  \\nobtained in writing using an \\'Informed Consent Form\\'. Both the  \\npatient information sheet as well as the Informed Consent Form  \\nshould have been approved by the ethics committee and furnished to  \\nthe Licensing Authority. Any changes in the informed consent  \\ndocuments should be approved by the ethics committee and  \\nsubmitted to the Licensing Authority before such changes are  \\nimplemented.  \\n(ii)    Where a subject is not able to give informed consent  \\n(e.g. \\n an  \\nunconscious person or a minor or those suffering from severe mental  \\nillness or disability), the same may be obtained from a legally  \\nacceptable representative [a legally acceptable representative is a  \\nperson who is able to give consent for or authorize an intervention in  \\nthe patient as provided by the law(s) of India]. If the subject or  \\nhis/her legally acceptable representative is unable to read/write - an  \\nimpartial witness should be present during the entire informed  \\nconsent process who must append his/her signatures to the consent  \\nform.  \\n(iii)   A checklist of essential elements to be included in the study subject  \\ns informed consent document as well as a format for the Informed  \\nConsent Form for study subjects is given in Appendix V.  \\n\\n[(iv) An audio-video recording of the informed consent process in case  \\nof vulnerable subjects in clinical trials of New Chemical Entity or  \\nNew Molecular Entity including procedure of providing information  \\nto the subject and his understanding on such consent, shall be  \\nmaintained by the investigator for record:Provided that in case of clinical trial of anti-HIV and anti- \\nLeprosy drugs, only audio recording of the informed consent process  \\nof individual subject including the procedure of providing  \\ninformation to the subject and his understanding on such consent  \\nshall De maintained by the investigator for record.]  \\n(5)  \\nResponsibilities of the Ethics Committee \\n—  \\n(i)    It is the responsibility of the ethics committee that reviews and  \\naccords its approval to a trial protocol to safeguard the rights, safety  \\nand well being of all trial subjects. The ethics committee should  \\nexercise particular care to protect the rights, safety and well being of  \\nall vulnerable subjects participating in the study,  \\ne.g., \\n members of a  \\ngroup with hierarchical structure  \\n(e.g. \\n prisoners, armed forces  \\npersonnel, staff and students of medical, nursing and pharmacy  \\nacademic institutions), patients with incurable diseases, unemployed  \\nor impoverished persons, patients in emergency situation, ethnic  \\nminority groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, minors or  \\nothers incapable of personally giving consent. Ethics committee(s)  \\nshould get document \\'standard operating procedures\\' and should  \\nmaintain a record of its proceedings.  \\n(ii)    Ethics Committee(s) should make, at appropriate intervals, an  \\nongoing review of the trials for which they review the protocol(s).  \\nSuch a review may be based on the periodic study progress reports  \\nfurnished by the investigators and/or monitoring and internal audit  \\nreports furnished by the sponsor and/or by visiting the study sites.  \\n(iii)    In case an ethics committee revokes its approval accorded to a trial  \\nprotocol, it must record the reasons for doing so ana at once  \\ncommunicate such a decision to the Investigator as well as to the  \\nLicensing Authority.  \\n\\n[(iv) In case of serious adverse event occurring to the clinical trial  \\nsubject, the Ethics Committee shall forward its report on the serious  \\nadverse event, after due analysis, along with its opinion on the  \\nfinancial compensation, if any, to be paid by the Sponsor or his  \\nrepresentative, whosoever had obtained permission from the  \\nLicensing Authority as referred to in clause (b) of rule 21 forconducting the clinical trial, to the Licensing Authority within thirty  \\ndays of the occurrence of the serious adverse event.]  \\n\\n[5(A) Serious Adverse Events \\n—  \\n(1)    A serious adverse event is an untoward medical occurrence during  \\nclinical trial that is associated with death, in patient hospitalisation  \\n(in case the study was being conducted on out-patient), prolongation  \\nof hospitalisation (in case the study was being conducted on in- \\npatient), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a  \\ncongenital anomaly or birth defect or is otherwise life threatening.  \\n(2)    The Investigator shall report all serious  \\n\\n[***] adverse events to  \\nthe Licensing Authority as defined under clause (b) of rule 21, the  \\nSponsor or his representative, whosoever had obtained permission  \\nfrom the Licensing Authority for conduct of the clinical trial, and the  \\nEthics Committee that accorded approval to the study protocol,  \\nwithin twenty four hours of their occurrence as per Appendix XI,  \\nand the said Licensing Authority shall determine the cause of injury  \\nor death as per the procedure prescribed under Appendix XII and  \\npass orders as deemed necessary.]  \\n\\n[ln case, the Investigator fails  \\nto report any serious adverse event within the stipulated period, he  \\nshall have to furnish the reason for the delay to the satisfaction of the  \\nLicensing Authority along with the report of the serious adverse  \\nevent.]  \\n(6)  \\nHuman Pharmacology (Phase I \\n)—  \\n(i)    The objective of studies in this phase is the estimation of safety and  \\ntolerabiiity with the initial administration of an investigational new  \\ndrug into human(s). Studies in this phase of development usually  \\nhave non-therapeutic objectives and may be conducted in heallhy  \\nvolunteers subjects or certain types of patients. Drugs will,  \\nsignificant potential toxicity  \\ne.g. \\n cytotoxic drugs are usually studied  \\nin patients. Phase I trials should preferably be carried out by  \\ninvestigators trained in clinical pharmacology with access to the  \\nnecessary facilities to closely observe and monitor the subjects.(ii)    Studies conducted in Phase I, usually intended to involve one or a  \\ncombination of the following objectives:—  \\n(a)     \\nMaximum Tolerated Dose: \\n To determine the tolerabiiity of the  \\ndose range expected to be needed later clinical studies and to  \\ndetermine tlie nature of adverse reactions that can be expected.  \\nThese studies include both single and multiple dose  \\nadministration.  \\n(b)    Pharmacokinetics,  \\ni.e., \\n characterization of drug\\'s absorption,  \\ndistribution, metabolism and excretion. Although these studies  \\ncontinue throughout the development plan, they should be  \\nperformed to support formulation development and determine  \\npharmacokinetic parameters in different age groups to support  \\ndosing recommendations.  \\n(c)     \\nPharmacodynamics: \\n Depending on the drug and the endpoints  \\nstudied, pharmacodynamic studies and studies relating to drug  \\nblood levels (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies) may  \\nbe conducted in healthy volunteer subjects or in patients with  \\nthe target disease. If there are appropriate validated indicators  \\nof activity and potential efficacy, pharmacodynamic data  \\nobtained from patients may guide the dosage and dose regimen  \\nto be applied in later studies.  \\n( \\nd)  \\nEarly Measurement of Drug Activity: \\n Preliminary studies of  \\nactivity or potential therapeutic benefit may be conducted in  \\nPhase I as a secondary objective. Such studies are generally  \\nperformed in later phases but may be appropriate when drug  \\nactivity is readily measurable with a short duration of drug  \\nexposure in patients at this early stage.  \\n(7)     \\nTherapeutic Exploratory Trials (Phase II \\n)—  \\n(i)    The primary objective of Phase II trials is to evaluate the  \\neffectiveness of a drug for a particular indication or indications in  \\npatients with the condition under study and to determine the  \\ncommon short-term side-effects and risks associated with the drug.  \\nStudies in Phase II should be conducted in a group of patients whoare selected by relatively narrow criteria leading to a relatively  \\nhomogeneous population. These studies should be closely  \\nmonitored. An important goal for this phase is to determine the  \\ndose(s) and regimen for Phase m trials. Doses used in Phase II are  \\nusually (but not always) less than the highest doses used in Phase I.  \\n(ii)    Additional objectives of Phase II studies can include evaluation of  \\npotential  \\nstudy  \\nendpoints,  \\ntherapeutic  \\nregimens  \\n(including  \\nconcomitant medications) and target populations  \\n(e.g. \\n mild versus  \\nsevere disease) for further studies in Phase II or Phase III. These  \\nobjectives may be served by exploratory analyses, examining  \\nsubsets of data and by including multiple endpoints in trials.  \\n(iii)    If the application is for conduct of clinical trials as a part of multi- \\nnational clinical development of the drug, the number of sites and  \\nthe patients as well as the justification for undertaking such trials in  \\nIndia shall be provided to the Licensing Authority.  \\n(8)     \\nTherapeutic Confirmatory Trials (Phase III \\n)—  \\n(i)    Phase III studies have primary objective of demonstration or  \\nconfirmation of therapeutic benefit(s). Studies in Phase III are  \\ndesigned to confirm the preliminary evidence accumulated in Phase  \\nII that a drug is safe and effective for use in the intended indication  \\nand recipient population. These studies should be intended to  \\nprovide an adequate basis for marketing approval. Studies in Phase  \\nIII may also further explore the dose-response relationships  \\n(relationships among dose, drug concentration in blood and clinical  \\nresponse), use of the drug in wider populations, in different stages of  \\ndisease, or the safety and efficacy of the drug in combination with  \\nother drug(s).  \\n(ii)    For drugs intended to be administered for long periods, trials  \\ninvolving extended exposure to the drug are ordinarily conducted in  \\nPhase III, although they may be initiated in Phase II. These studies  \\ncarried out in Phase III complete the information needed to support  \\nadequate instructions for use of the drug (prescribing information).(iii)    For new drugs approved outside India, Phase III studies need to be  \\ncarried out primarily to generate evidence of efficacy and safety of  \\nthe drug in Indian patients when used as recommended in the  \\nprescribing information. Prior to conduct of Phase III studies in  \\nIndian subjects, Licensing Authority may require pharmacokinetic  \\nstudies to be undertaken to verify that the data generated in Indian  \\npopulation is in conformity with the data already generated abroad.  \\n(iv)    If the application is for the conduct of clinical trials as a part of  \\nmulti national clinical development of the drug, the number of sites  \\nand patients as well as the justification for undertaking such trials in  \\nIndia should be provided to the Licensing Authority along with the  \\napplication.  \\n(9)  \\nPost Marketing Trials (Phase IV \\n)—  \\nPost Marketing trials are studies (other than routine surveillance) performed  \\nafter drug approval and related to the approved indication(s). These trials go  \\nbeyond the prior demonstration of the drug\\'s safety, efficacy and dose  \\ndefinition. These trials may not be considered necessary at the time of new drug  \\napproval but may be required by the Licensing Authority for optimizing the  \\ndrug\\'s use. They may be of any type but should have valid scientific objectives.  \\nPhase IV trials include additional drug-drug interaction(s), dose-response or  \\nsafety studies and trials designed to support use under the approved  \\nindication(s),  \\ne.g. \\n mortality/morbidity studies, epidemiological studies, etc.  \\n3. Studies in Special Populations.— \\nInformation supporting the use of the  \\ndrug in children, pregnant women, nursing women, elderly patients, patients  \\nwith renal or other organ systems failure, and those on specific concomitant  \\nmedication is required to be submitted if relevant to the clinical profile of the  \\ndrug and its anticipated usage pattern. Any claim sought to be made for the drug  \\nproduct that is not based on data submitted under preceding items of this  \\nSchedule should be supported by studies included under this item of the  \\nSchedule (Appendix I, Item 8.3).  \\n(1)     \\nGeriatrics \\n—Geriatric patients should be included in Phase III clinical  \\ntrials (and in Phase II trials, at the sponsor\\'s option) in meaningful numbers, if—(a)    the disease intended to be treated is characteristically a disease of  \\naging; or  \\n(b)    the population to be treated is known to include substantial numbers  \\nof geriatric patients; or  \\n(c)    when there is specific reason to expect that conditions common in  \\nthe elderly are likely to be encountered; or  \\n(d)    when the new drug is likely to alter the geriatric patient\\'s response  \\n(with regard to safety or efficacy) compared with that of the non- \\ngeriatric patient.  \\n(2)     \\nPaediatrics. \\n—(i) The timing of paediatric studies in the new drug  \\ndevelopment program will depend on the medicinal product, the type of disease  \\nbeing treated, safety considerations, and the efficacy and safety of available  \\ntreatments. For a drug expected to be used in children, evaluations should be  \\nmade in the appropriate age group. When clinical development is to include  \\nstudies in children, it is usually appropriate to begin with older children before  \\nextending the trial to younger children and then infants.  \\n(ii)    If the new drug is for diseases predominantly or exclusively affecting  \\npaediatric patients, clinical trial data should be generated in the paediatric  \\npopulation except for initial safety and tolerability data, which will usually be  \\nobtained in adults unless such initial safety studies in adults would yield little  \\nuseful information or expose them to inappropriate risk.  \\n(iii)    If the new drug is intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases,  \\noccurring in both adults and paediatric patients, for which there are currently no  \\nor limited therapeutic options, paediatric population should be included in the  \\nclinical trials early, following assessment of initial safety data and reasonable  \\nevidence of potential benefit. In circumstances where this is not possible, lack  \\nof data should be justified in detail.  \\n(iv)    If the new drug has a potential for use in paediatric patients -  \\npaediatric studies should be conducted. These studies may be initiated at various  \\nphases of clinical development or after post-marketing surveillance in adults if a  \\nsafety concern exists. In cases where there is limited paediatric data at the timeof submission of application -more data in paediatric patients would be  \\nexpected after marketing authorisation for use in children is granted.  \\n(v)    The paediatric studies should include—  \\n(a) clinical trials,  \\n(b) relative bioequivalence comparisons of the paediatric formulation  \\nwith the adult formulation performed in adults, and  \\n(c)    definitive pharmacokinetic studies for dose: selection across the age  \\nranges of paediatric patients in whom the drug is likely to be used.  \\nThese studies should be conducted in the paediatric patient  \\npopulation with the disease under study.  \\n(vi)    If the new \\n\\n drug is a major therapeutic advance for the paediatric  \\npopulation -the studies should begin early in the drug development, and this  \\ndata should be submitted with the new drug application.  \\n(vii)    Paediatric subjects are legally unable to provide written informed  \\nconsent, and are dependent on their parent(s)/legal guardian to assume  \\nresponsibility for their participation in clinical studies. Written informed  \\nconsent should be obtained from the parent/legal guardian. However, all  \\npaediatric participants should be informed to the fullest extent possible about  \\nthe study in a language and in terms that they are able to understand. Where  \\nappropriate, paediatric participants should additionally assent to enrol in the  \\nstudy. Mature minors and adolescents should personally sign and date a  \\nseparately designed written assent form. Although a participant\\'s wish to  \\nwithdraw from a study must be respected, there may be circumstances in  \\ntherapeutic studies, for serious or life-threatening diseases in which,, in the  \\nopinion of the Investigator and parent(s)/ legal guardian, the welfare of a  \\npediatric patient would be jeopardized by his or her failing to participate in the  \\nstudy. In this situation, continued parental/legal guardian consent should be  \\nsufficient\\'to allow participation in the study.  \\n(viii) For clinical trials conducted in the paediatric pdpulation, the reviewing  \\nethics committee should include members who are knowledgeable about  \\npaediatric, ethical, clinical and psychosocial issues.(3)  \\nPregnant or Nursing Women. \\n—(i) Pregnant or\\'nursing women should be  \\nincludes in clinical trials only when the drug is intended for use by  \\npregnant/nursing women or foetuses/nursing infants and where the data  \\ngenerated from women who are not pregnant or nursing, is not suitable.  \\n(ii) For new drugs intended for use during pregnancy, follow-up data  \\n(pertaining to a period appropriate for that drug) on the pregnancy, foetus and  \\nchild will be required. Where applicable, excretion of the drug: or iits  \\nmetabolites into human milk should be examined and the infant should be  \\nmonitored for predicted pharmacological effects of the drug. \\n   \\n  \\n\\n[(4)  \\nPost Marketing Surveillance — \\n (i) The applicant shall have a  \\npharmacovigilance system in place for collecting, processing and forwarding  \\nthe report to the licensing authority for, information on adverse drug reactions  \\nemerging from the use of the drug manufactured or marketed by the applicant in  \\nthe country.  \\n(ia) The system shall be managed by qualified and trained personnel and the  \\nofficer in-charge of collection and processing of data shall be a medical officer  \\nor a pharmacist trained in collection and analysis of adverse drug reaction  \\n(ib)    Subsequent to approval of the product, new drug shall be closely  \\nmonitored for its clinical safety once it is marketed.  \\n(ic)    The applicant shall furnish Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) in  \\norder to—  \\n(a)    report all relevant new information from appropriate sources;  \\n(b)    relate the data to patient exposure;  \\n(c)    summarise the market authorisation status in different countries and  \\nany significant variations related to safety; and  \\n(d)    indicate whether changes shall be made to product information in  \\norder to optimise the use of product.]  \\n(ii)    Ordinarily all dosage forms and formulations as well as indications for  \\nnew drugs should be covered in one PSUR. Within the single PSUR separatepresentations of data for different dosage forms, indications or separate  \\npopulation need to be given.  \\n(iii)    All relevant clinical and non-clinical safety data should cover only  \\nthe period of the report (interval data). The PSURs shall be \\n\\n submitted every six  \\nmonths for the first two years after approval of the drug is granted to the  \\napplicant. For subsequent two. years -the PSURs need to be submitted annually.  \\nLicensing authority may extend the total duration of submission of PSURs if it  \\nis considered necessary in the interest of public health. PSURs due for a period  \\nmust be submitted within 30 calendar days of the last day of the reporting  \\nperiod. However, all cases involving serious unexpected adverse reactions must  \\nbe reported to the licensing authority \\n  \\nwithin 15 days of initial receipt of the  \\ninformation by the applicant. If marketing of the new drug is delayed by the  \\napplicant after obtaining approval to market, such data will have to be provided  \\non the deferred basis beginning from the time the new drug is marketed.  \\n(iv)    New studies specifically planned or conducted to examine a safety  \\nissue should be described in the PSURs.      \\n(v)    A PSUR should be structured as follows:— \\n     \\n  \\n(a)     \\nA title page stating: \\n Periodic safety update report for the product;  \\napplicant\\'s name, period covered by the report, date of approval of  \\nnew drug, date of  marketing of new drug and date of reporting;      \\n(b)    Introduction;      \\n(c)    Current worldwide market authorization status  \\n(d)    Update of actions taken for safety reasons;   \\n(e)    Changes to reference safety information;  \\n(f)    Estimated patient exposure;  \\n(g)    Presentation of individual case histories;  \\n(h)    Studies;  \\n(i)    Other information;  \\n(j) Overall safety evaluation;  \\n(k) Conclusion;  \\n(l) Appendix providing material relating to indications, dosing,  \\npharmacology and other related information.  \\n(5)  \\nSpecial studies: Bioavailability/Bioequivalence studies:(i) drugs approved elsewhere in the world and absorbed systemically,  \\nBioequivalence With the reference formulation should be carried out wherever  \\napplicable. These studies should be conducted under the labelled conditions of  \\nadministration. Data on the extent of systemic absorption may be required for  \\nformulations other than those designed for systemic absorption.  \\n(ii)    Evaluation of the effect of food on absorption following oral  \\nadministration should be carried out. Data from dissolution studies should also  \\nbe submitted for all solid oral dosage forms.  \\n(iii)    Dissolution and bioavailability data submitted with the new drug  \\napplication must provide information that assures bioequivalence or establishes  \\nbioavailability and dosage correlations between the formulation(s) sought to be  \\nmarketed and those used for clinical trials during clinical development of the  \\nproduct.  \\n(See \\n Items 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 of Appendix I).  \\n(iv)    All bioavailability and bioequivalence studies should be conducted  \\naccording to the Guidelines for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies as  \\nprescribed.  \\nNote.— \\nThe data requirements stated in this Schedule are expected to  \\nprovide adequate information to evaluate the efficacy, safety and therapeutic  \\nrationale of new drugs (as defined under rule 122-E) prior to the permission for  \\nsale. Depending upon the nature of new drugs and disease(s), additional  \\ninformation may be required by the Licensing Authority.

Briefly, these studies should be performed by  \\nsuitably trained and qualified staff employing properly calibrated and  \\nstandardized equipment of adequate size and capacity. Studies should be done  \\nas per written protocols with modifications (if any) verifiable retrospectively.  \\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) should be followed for all managerial  \\nand laboratory tasks related to these studies. Test substances and test systems  \\n(in-vitro or in-vivo) should be properly characterized and standardized. All  \\ndocuments belonging to each study, including its approved protocol, raw data,  \\ndraft report, final report, and histology slides and paraffin tissue blocks should  \\nbe preserved for a minimum of 5 years after marketing of the drug.  \\nToxicokinetic studies (generation of pharmacokinetic data either as an  \\nintegral component of the conduct of non-clinical toxicity studies or in specially  \\ndesigned studies) should be conducted to assess the systemic exposure achieved  \\nin animals and its relationship to dose level and the time course of the toxicity  \\nstudy. Other objectives of toxicokinetic studies include obtaining data to relate  \\nthe exposure achieved in toxicity studies to toxicological findings and  \\ncontribute to the assessment of the relevance of these findings to clinical safety,  \\nto support the choice of species and treatment regimen in non-clinical toxicity  \\nstudies and to provide information which, in conjunction with the toxicity  \\nfindings, contributes to the design of subsequent non-clinical toxicity studies.  \\n1.1     \\nSystemic Toxicity Studies  \\n1.1.1     \\nSingle-dose Toxicity Studies: \\n These studies (see Appendix I, Item 4.2)  \\nshould be carried out in 2 rodent species (mice and rats) using the same route as  \\nintended for humans. In addition, unless the intended route of administration in  \\nhumans is only intravenous, at least one more route should be used in one of the  \\nspecies to ensure systemic absorption of the drug. This route should depend on  \\nthe nature of the drug. A limit of 2g/kg (or 10 times the normal dose that isintended in humans, whichever is higher) is recommended for oral dosing.  \\nAnimals should be observed for 14 days after the drug administration, and  \\nminimum lethal dose (MLD) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) should be  \\nestablished. If possible, the target organ of toxicity should also be determined.  \\nMortality should be observed for up to 7 days after parenteral administration  \\nand up to 14 days after oral administration. Symptoms, signs and mode of death  \\nshould be reported, with appropriate macroscopic and microscopic findings  \\nwhere necessary. LD \\n\\n and LD \\n\\n should be reported preferably with 95 per cent  \\nconfidence limits. If LD \\n\\ns cannot be determined, reasons for the same should  \\nbe stated.  \\nThe dose causing severe toxic manifestations or death should be defined in  \\nthe case of cytotoxic anticancer agents, and the post-dosing observation period  \\nshould be up to 14 days. Mice should first be used for determination of MTD.  \\nFindings should then be confirmed in rat for establishing linear relationship  \\nbetween toxicity and body surface area. In case of nonlinearity, data of the more  \\nsensitive species should be used to determine the Phase I starting dose. Where  \\nrodents are known to be poor predictors of human toxicity  \\n(e.g.,  \\nantifolates), or  \\nwhere the cytotoxic drug acts by a novel mechanism of action, MTD should be  \\nestablished in non-rodent species.  \\n1.1.2     \\nRepeated-dose Systemic Toxicity Studies: \\n These studies  \\n(see \\n Appendix I,  \\nItem 4.2) should be carried out in at least two mammalian species, of which one  \\nshould be a non-rodent. Dose ranging studies should precede the 14-, 28-, 90- or  \\n180-day toxicity studies. Duration of the final systemic toxicity study will  \\ndepend on the duration, therapeutic indication and scale of the proposed clinical  \\ntrial  \\n(see \\n Item 1.8). If a species is known to metabolize the drug in the same way  \\nas humans, it should be preferred for toxicity studies.  \\nIn repeated-dose toxicity studies the drug should be administered 7 days a  \\nweek by the route intended for clinical use. The number of animals required for  \\nthese studies,  \\ni.e. \\n the minimum number of animals on which data should be  \\navailable, is shown in Item 1.9.  \\nWherever applicable, a control group of animals given the vehicle alone  \\nshould be included, and three other groups should be given graded doses of the  \\ndrug. The highest dose should produce observable toxicity; the lowest dose  \\nshould not cause observable toxicity, but should be comparable to the intendedtherapeutic dose in humans or a multiple of it. To make allowance for the  \\nsensitivity of the species the intermediate dose should cause some symptoms,  \\nbut not gross toxicity or death, and should be placed logarithmically between  \\nthe other two doses.  \\nThe parameters to be monitored and recorded in long-term toxicity studies  \\nshould include behavioural, physiological, biochemical and microscopic  \\nobservations. In case of parenteral drug administration, the sites of injection  \\nshould be subjected to gross and microscopic examination. Initial and final  \\nelectrocardiogram and fundus examination should be carried out in the non- \\nrodent species.  \\nIn the case of cytotoxic anticancer agents dosing and study design should be  \\nin accordance with the proposed clinical schedule in terms of days of exposure  \\nand number of cycles Two rodent species may be tested for initiating Phase I  \\ntrials. A non-rodent species should be added if the drug has a novel mechanism  \\nof action, or if permission for Phase II, III or marketing is being sought.  \\nFor most compounds, it is expected that single dose tissue distribution studies  \\nwith sufficient sensitivity and specificity will provide an adequate assessment of  \\ntissue distribution and the potential for accumulation. Thus, repeated dose tissue  \\ndistribution studies should not be required uniformly for all compounds and  \\nshould only be conducted when appropriate data cannot be derived from other  \\nsources. Repeated dose studies may be appropriate under certain circumstances  \\nbased on the data from single dose tissue distribution studies, toxicity and  \\ntoxicokinetic studies. The studies may be most appropriate for compounds  \\nwhich have an apparently long half life, incomplete elimination or unanticipated  \\norgan toxicity.  \\nNotes \\n.—(i)  \\nSingle Dose Toxicity Study: \\n Each group should contain at least 5  \\nanimals of either sex. At least four graded should be given. Animals should be  \\nexposed to the test substance in a single bolus or by continuous infusion or  \\nseveral doses within 24 hours. Animals should be observed for 14 days. Signs  \\nof intoxication, effect on body weight, gross pathological \\n  \\nchanges should be  \\nreported. It is desirable to include histo-pathology of grossly affected organs, if  \\nany.  \\n(ii)  \\nDose-ranging Study: \\n Objectives of this study include the identification of  \\ntarget organ of toxicity and establishment of MTD for subsequent studies.(a)    Rodents: Study should be performed in one rodent species  \\n(preferably rat) by the proposed clinical route of administration. At least  \\nfour graded doses including control should be given, and each dose group  \\nas well as the vehicle control should consist of a minimum of 5 animals  \\nof each sex. Animals should be exposed to the test substance daily for 10  \\nconsecutive days. Highest dose should be the maximum tolerated dose of  \\nsingle-dose study. Animals should be observed daily for signs of  \\nintoxication (general appearance, activity and behaviour etc.), and  \\nperiodically for the body weight and laboratory parameters. Gioss  \\nexamination of Viscera and microscopic examination of affected organs  \\nshould be done.  \\n(b)     \\nNon-rodents: \\n One male and one female are to be taken for  \\nascending phase MTD study. Dosing should start after initial recording of  \\ncage-side and laboratory parameters. Starting dose may be 3 to 5 times  \\nthe extrapolated effective dose or MTD (whichever is less), and dose  \\nescalation in suitable steps should be done every third day after drawing  \\nthe samples for laboratory parameters. Dose should be lowered  \\nappropriately when clinical or laboratory evidence of toxicity are  \\nobserved. Administration of test substance should then continue for 10  \\ndays at the well-tolerated dose level following which, samples for  \\nlaboratory parameters should be taken. Sacrifice, autopsy and  \\nmicroscopic examination of affected tissues should be performed as in the  \\ncase of rodents..  \\n(iii) \\n  \\n14-28 Day repeated-dose toxicity studies: \\n One rodent (6-10/sex/group)  \\nand one non-rodent (2-3/sex/group) species are needed. Daily dosing by  \\nproposed clinical route at three dose levels should be done with highest dose  \\nhaving observable toxicity, mid- dose between high and low dose, and low  \\ndose. The doses should preferably be multiples of the effective dose and free  \\nfrom toxicity. Observation parameters should include cage- side observations,  \\nbody weight changes, food/water intake, blood biochemistry, haematology, and  \\ngross and microscopic studies of all viscera and tissues.  \\n(iv \\n)    90-Day repeated-dose toxicity studies: \\n One rodent (15-30/sex/group)  \\nand one non- rodent (4-6/sex/group) species are needed. Daily dosing by  \\nproposed clinical route at three graded dose levels should be done. In addition to  \\nthe control a “high-dose-reversal” group and its control group should be alsoincluded. Parameters should include signs of intoxication (general appearance,  \\nactivity and behaviour etc), body weight, food intake, blood biochemical  \\nparameters, haematological values, urine analysis, organ weights, gross and  \\nmicroscopic study of viscera and tissues. Half the animals in “reversal” groups  \\n(treated and control) should be sacrificed after 14 days of stopping the  \\ntreatment. The remaining animals should be sacrificed after 28 days of stopping  \\nthe treatment or after the recovery of signs and/or clinical pathological changes  \\n– whichever comes later, and evaluated for the parameters used for the main  \\nstudy.  \\n(v)   \\n180-Day repeated-dose toxicity studies \\n:  \\nOne rodent (15-30/sex/group)  \\nand one non-rodent (4-6/sex/group) species are needed. At least 4 groups,  \\nincluding control, should be taken. Daily dosing by proposed clinical route at  \\nthree graded dose levels should be done. Parameters should include signs of  \\nintoxication, body weight, food intake, blood biochemistry, hematology, urine  \\nanalysis, organ weights, gross and microscopic examination of organs and  \\ntissues.  \\n1.2 Male Fertility Study:  \\nOne rodent species (preferably rat) should be used. Dose selection  \\nshould be done from the results of the previous 14 or 28-day toxicity study in  \\nrat. Three dose groups, the highest one showing minimal toxicity in systemic  \\nstudies, and a control group should be taken. Each group should consist of 6  \\nadult male animals. Animals should be treated with the test substance by the  \\nintended route of clinical use for minimum 28 days and maximum 70 days  \\nbefore they are paired with female animals of proven fertility in a ratio of 1:2  \\nfor mating.   \\nDrug treatment of the male animals should continue during pairing.  \\nPairing should be continued till the detection of vaginal plug or 10 days,  \\nwhichever is earlier. Females getting thus pregnant should be examined for their  \\nfertility index after day 13 of gestation. All the male animals should be  \\nsacrificed at the end of the study. Weights of each testis and epididymis should  \\nbe separately recorded. Sperms from one epididymis should be examined for  \\ntheir motility and morphology. The other epididymis and both testes should be  \\nexamined for their histology.1.3 Female Reproduction and:Developmental Toxicity Studies:  \\nThese studies (see Appendix I, item 4.4) need to be carried out for all drugs  \\nproposed to be studied or used in women of child bearing age. Segment I, II and  \\nIII studies (see below) are to be performed in albino mice or rats, and segment II  \\nstudy should include albino rabbits also as a second test species.   \\nOn the occasion, when the test article is not compatible with the rabbit (e.g.  \\nantibiotics which are effective against gram positive, anaerobic organisms and  \\nprotozoas) the Segment II data in the mouse may be substituted.   \\n1.3.1  \\nFemale Fertility Study (Segment I): \\n The study should be done in one  \\nrodent species (rat preferred). The drug should be administered to both  \\nmales \\nand females, beginning a sufficient number of days (28 days in males and  \\n14 days in females) before mating. Drug treatment should continue during  \\nmating and, subsequently, during the gestation period. Three graded doses  \\nshould be used, the highest dose (usually the MTD obtained from previous  \\nsystemic toxicity studies) should not affect general health of the parent animals.  \\nAt least 15 males and 15 females should be used per dose group. Control and  \\nthe treated groups should be of similar size. The route of administration should  \\nbe the same as intended for therapeutic use.  \\nDams should be allowed to litter and their mcdication should be continued till  \\nthe weaning of pups. Observations on body weight, food intake, clinical signs of  \\nintoxication, mating behaviour, progress of gestation/parturition periods, length  \\nof gestation, parturition, post-partem health and gross pathology (and  \\nhistopathology of affected organs) of dams should be recorded. The pups from  \\nboth treated and control groups should be observed for general signs of  \\nintoxication, sex-wise distribution in different treatment groups, body weight,  \\ngrowth parameters, survival, gross examination, and autopsy. Histopathology of  \\naffected organs should be done.  \\n1.3.2  \\nTeratogenicity Study (Segment II): \\n One rodent (preferably rat) and one  \\nnon-rodent (rabbit) species are to be used. The drug should be administered  \\nthroughout the period of organogenesis, using three dose levels as described for  \\nSegment I. The highest dose should cause minimum material toxicity and the  \\nlowest one should be proportional to the proposed dose for clinical use in  \\nhumans or a multiple of it. The route of administration should be the same as  \\nintended for human therapeutic use.The control and the treated groups should consist of at least 20 pregnant rats  \\n(or mice) and 12 rabbits, on each dose level. All foetuses should to be subjected  \\nto gross examination, one of the foetuses should be examined for skeletal  \\nabnormalities and the other half for visceral abnormalities. Observation  \\nparameters should include: (Dams) signs of intoxication, effect on body weight,  \\neffect on food intake, examination of uterus, ovaries and uterine contents,  \\nnumber of corpora lutea, implantation sites, resorption (if any); and for the  \\nfoetuses, the total number, gender, body length, weight and gross/  \\nvisceral/skeletal abnormalities, if any.  \\n1.3.3     \\nPerinatal Study (Segment III): \\n This study is specially recommended if  \\nthe drug is to be given to pregnant or nursing mothers for long periods or where  \\nthere are indications of possible adverse effects on foetal development. One  \\nrodent species (preferably rat) is needed. Dosing at levels comparable to  \\nmultiples of human dose should be done by the intended clinical route. At least  \\n4 groups (including control), each consisting of 15 dams should be used. The  \\ndrug should be administered throughout the last trimester of pregnancy (from  \\nday 15 of gestation) and then the dose that causes low foetal loss should be  \\ncontinued throughout lactation and weaning. Dams should then be sacrificed  \\nand examined as described below.  \\nOne male and one female from each litter of F \\n\\n generation (total 15 males and  \\n15 females in each group) should be selected at weaning and treated with  \\nvehicle or test substance (at the dose levels described above) throughout their  \\nperiods of growth to sexual maturity, pairing, gestation, parturition and  \\nlactation. Mating performance and fertility of F \\n\\n generation should thus be  \\nevaluated to obtain the F \\n\\n generation whose growth parameters should be  \\nmonitored till weaning. The criteria of evaluation should be the same as  \\ndescribed earlier (3.4.1).   \\nAnimals should be sacrificed at the end of the study and the observation  \\nparameters should include (Dams) body weight, food intake, general signs of  \\nintoxication, progress of gestation/ parturition periods and gross pathology (if  \\nany); and for pups, the clinical signs, sex-wise distribution in dose groups, body  \\nweight, growth parameters, gross examination, survival and autopsy (if needed)  \\nand where necessary, histopathology.1.4 Local Toxicity  \\nThese studies (see Appendix I, item 4.5) are required when the new drug is  \\nproposed to be used by some special route (other than oral) in humans. The drug  \\nshould be applied to an appropriate site (e.g., skin or vaginal mucous  \\nmembrane) to determine local effects in a suitable species. Typical study  \\ndesigns for these studies should include three dose levels and untreated and/ or  \\nvehicle control, preferably use of 2 species, and increasing group size with  \\nincrease in duration of treatment. Where dosing is restricted due to anatomical  \\nor humane reasons, or the drug concentration cannot be increased beyond a  \\ncertain level due to the problems of solubility, pH or tonicity, a clear statement  \\nto this effect should be given. If the drug is absorbed from the site of  \\napplication, appropriate systemic toxicity studies will also be required.  \\nNotes \\n (i)  \\nDermal toxicity study: \\n The study should be done in rabbit and rat.  \\n\\n[The initial toxicity  study shall be carried out by non—animal alternative  \\ntests as given in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  \\nGuidelines.] Test material should be applied on shaved skin covering not less  \\nthan 10% of the total body surface area. Porous gauze dressing should be used  \\nto hold liquid material in place. Formulations with different concentrations (at  \\nleast 3) of test substance, several fold higher than the clinical dosage form  \\nshould be used. Period of application may vary from 7 to 90 days depending on  \\nthe clinical duration of use. Where skin irritation is grossly visible in the initial  \\nstudies, a recovery group should be included in the subsequent repeated-dose  \\nstudy. Local signs (erythema, oedema and eschar formation) as well as  \\nhistological examination of sites of application should be used for evaluation of  \\nresults.  \\n(ii)  \\nPhoto-allergy or dermal photo-toxicity \\n: It should be tested by Armstrong/  \\nHarber Test in guinea pig. This test should be done if the drug or a metabolite is  \\nrelated to an agent causing photosensitivity or the nature of action suggests such  \\na potential (e.g., drugs to be used in treatment of leucoderma). Pretest in 8  \\nanimals should screen 4 concentrations (patch application for 2 hours ±15 min.)  \\nwith and without UV exposure (10 J/cm \\n\\n). Observations recorded at 24 and 48  \\nhours should be used to ascertain highest nonirritant dose. Main test should be  \\nperformed with 10 test animals and 5 controls. Induction with the dose selected  \\nfrom pretest should use 0.3 ml/patch for 2 hour ±15 min. followed by 10 J/cm2  \\nof UV exposure. This should be repeated on day 0, 2,4,7,9 and 11 of the test.Animals should be challenged with the same concentration of test substance  \\nbetween day 20 to 24 of the test with a similar 2-hour application followed by  \\nexposure to 10 J/cm \\n\\n of UV light. Examination and grading of erythema and  \\noedema formation at the challenge sites should be done 24 and 48 hours after  \\nthe challenge. A positive control like musk ambrett or psoralin should be used.  \\n(iii)  \\nVaginal Toxicity Test \\n: Study is to be done in rabbit or dog. Test  \\nsubstance should be applied topically (vaginal mucosa) in the form of pessary,  \\ncream or ointment. Six to ten animals per dose group should be taken. Higher  \\nconcentrations or several daily applications of test substance should be done to  \\nachieve multiples of daily human dose. The minimum duration of drug  \\ntreatment is 7 days (more according to clinical use), subject to a maximum of 30  \\ndays. Observation parameters should include swelling, closure of introitus and  \\nhistopathology of vaginal wall.  \\n(iv)  \\nRectal Tolerance Test \\n: For all preparations meant for rectal administration  \\nthis test may be performed in rabbits or dogs. Six to ten animals per dose group  \\nshould be taken. Formulation in volume comparable to human dose (or the  \\nmaximum possible volume) should be applied once or several times daily, per  \\nrectally, to achieve administration of multiples of daily human dose. The  \\nminimum duration of application is 7 days (more according to clinical use),  \\nsubject to a maximum of 30 days. Size of suppositories may be smaller, but the  \\ndrug content should be several fold higher than the proposed human dose.  \\nObservation parameters should include clinical signs (sliding on backside),  \\nsigns of pain, blood and/or mucus in faeces, condition of anal region/sphincter,  \\ngross and (if required) histological examination of rectal mucosa.  \\n(v)  \\nParenteral Drugs: \\n For products meant for intravenous or intramuscular or  \\nsubcutaneous or intradermal injection the sites of injection in systemic toxicity  \\nstudies should be specially examined grossly and microscopically. If needed,  \\nreversibility of adverse effects may be determined on a case to case basis.   \\n(vi)  \\nOcular toxicity studies (for products meant for ocular instillation): \\n  \\nThese studies should be carried out in two species, one of which should be the  \\nalbino rabbit which has a sufficiently large conjunctival sac. Direct delivery of  \\ndrug onto the cornea in case of animals having small conjunctival sacs should  \\nbe ensured. Liquids, ointments, gels or soft contact lenses (saturated with drug)  \\nshould be used. Initial single dose application should be done to decide theexposure concentrations for repeated-dose studies and the need to include a  \\nrecovery group.  \\n\\n[Such initial toxicity studies shall be carried out by non- \\nanimal alternative tests as given in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  \\nDevelopment Guidelines].Duration of the final study will depend on the  \\nproposed length of human exposure subject to a maximum of 90 days. At least  \\ntwo different concentrations exceeding the human dose should be used for  \\ndemonstrating the margin of safety. In acute studies, one eye should be used for  \\ndrug administration and the other kept as control. A separate control group  \\nshould be included in repeated-dose studies.   \\nSlit-lamp examination should be done to detect the changes in cornea, iris  \\nand aqueous humor. Fluorescent dyes (sodium fluorescein, 0.25 to 1.0%) should  \\nbe used for detecting the defects in surface epithelium of cornea and  \\nconjunctiva. Changes in intra-ocular tension should be monitored by a  \\ntonometer. Histological examination of eyes should be done at the end of the  \\nstudy after fixation in Davidson‘s or Zenker‘s fluid.  \\n(vii)  \\nInhalation toxicity studies: \\n The studies are to be undertaken in one  \\nrodent and one non-rodent species using the formulation that is to be eventually  \\nproposed to be marketed. Acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies should be  \\nperformed according to the intended duration of human exposure. Standard  \\nsystemic toxicity study designs (described above) should be used. Gases and  \\nvapours should be given in whole body exposure chambers; aerosols are to be  \\ngiven by nose-only method. Exposure time and concentrations of test substance  \\n(limit dose of 5mg/l) should be adjusted to ensure exposure at levels comparable  \\nto multiples of intended human exposure. Three dose groups and a control (plus  \\nvehicle control, if needed) are required. Duration of exposure may vary subject  \\nto a maximum of 6 hours per day and five days a week. Food and water should  \\nbe withdrawn during the period of exposure to test substance.   \\nTemperature, humidity and flow rate of exposure chamber should be  \\nrecorded and reported. Evidence of exposure with test substance of particle size  \\nof 4 micron (especially for aerosols) with not less that 25% being 1 micron  \\nshould be provided. Effects on respiratory rate, findings of bronchial lavage  \\nfluid examination, histological examination of respiratory passages and lung  \\ntissue should be included along with the regular parameters of systemic toxicity  \\nstudies or assessment of margin of safety.1.5 Allergenicity/Hypersensitivity  \\nStandard tests include guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) and local lymph  \\nnode assay (LLNA) in mouse. Any one of the two may be done.  \\nNotes \\n (i)  \\nGuinea Pig Maximization Test \\n: The test is to be performed in two  \\nsteps; first, determination of maximum nonirritant and minimum irritant doses,  \\nand second, the main test. The initial study will also have two components. To  \\ndetermine the intradermal induction dose, 4 dose levels should be tested by the  \\nsame route in a batch of 4 male and 4 female animals (2 of each sex should be  \\ngiven Freund‘s adjuvant). The minimum irritant dose should be used for  \\ninduction. Similarly, a topical minimum irritant dose should be determined for  \\nchallenge. This should be established in 2 males and 2 females. A minimum of  \\n6 male and 6 female animals per group should be used in the main study. One  \\ntest and one control group should be used. It is preferable to have one more  \\npositive control group. Intradermal induction (day 1) coupled with topical  \\nchallenge (day 21) should be done. If there is no response, re-challenge should  \\nbe done 7-30 days after the primary challenge. Erythema and oedema  \\n(individual animal scores as well as maximization grading) should be used as  \\nevaluation criteria.  \\n(ii)  \\nLocal Lymph Node Assay \\n: Mice used in this test should be of the same  \\nsex, either only males or only females. Drug treatment is to be given on ear  \\nskin. Three graded doses, the highest being maximum nonirritant dose plus  \\nvehicle control should be used. A minimum of 6 mice per group should be used.  \\nTest material should be applied on ear skin on three consecutive days and on  \\nday 5, the draining auricular lymph nodes should be dissected out 5 hours after  \\ni.v. H-thymidine or bromo-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). Increase in H-thymidine or  \\nBrdU incorporation should be used as the criterion for evaluation of results.  \\n1.6 Genotoxicity  \\nGenotoxic compounds, in the absence of other data, shall be presumed to be  \\ntrans-species carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans. Such compounds need  \\nnot be subjected to long-term carcinogenicity studies. However, if such a drug is  \\nintended to be administered for chronic illnesses or otherwise over a long period  \\nof time - a chronic toxicity study (up to one year) may be necessary to detect  \\nearly tumorigenic effects.Genotoxicity tests are in vitro and in vivo tests conducted to detect  \\ncompounds which induce genetic damage directly or indirectly. These tests  \\nshould enable a hazard identification with respect to damage to DNA and its  \\nfixation.  \\nThe following standard test battery is generally expected to be conducted:  \\n(i)    A test for gene mutation in bacteria.  \\n(ii)    An in-vitro test with cytogenetic evaluation of chromosomal damage  \\nwith mammalian cells or an in vitro mouse lymphoma tic assay.  \\n(iii)    An in-vivo test for chromosomal damage using rodent hematopoietic  \\ncells. Other genotoxicity tests  \\ne.g. \\n tests for measurement of DNA adducts,  \\nDNA strand breaks, DNA repair or recombination serve as options in  \\naddition to the standard battery for further investigation of genotoxicity  \\ntest results obtained in the standard battery. Only under extreme conditions  \\nin which one or more tests comprising the standard battery cannot be  \\nemployed for technical reasons, alternative validated tests can serve as  \\nsubstitutes provided sufficient scientific justification should be provided to  \\nsupport the argument that a given standard battery test is not appropriate.   \\nBoth in-vitro and in-vivo studies should be done. In-vitro studies should  \\ninclude Ames\\' Salmonella Assay and Chromosomal Aberrations (CA) in  \\ncultured cells. In-vivo studies should include Micronucleus Assay (MNA)  \\nor CA in rodent bone marrow. Data analysis of CA should include analysis  \\nof \\'gaps\\'.  \\nCytotoxic Anticancer Agents: \\n Genotoxicity data are not required before Phase  \\nI and II trials. But these studies should be completed before applying for Phase  \\nIII trials.  \\nNotes.— \\nAmes\\' Test (Reverse Mutation Assay in Salmonella): \\n S.  \\ntyphimurium tester strains such as TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535, TA97 or  \\nEscherichia coli WP2 uvrA or Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA (pKM101) should be  \\nused.  \\n(i) In-vitro exposure (with and without metabolic activation, S9 mix) should be  \\ndone at a minimum of 5 log dose levels. \"Solvent\" and \"positive\" control shouldbe used. Positive control may include 9-amino-acridine, 2-nitrofluorine, sodium  \\nazide and mitomycin C, respectively, in the tester strains mentioned above.  \\nEach set should consist of at least three replicates. A 2.5 fold (or more) increase  \\nin number of revertants in comparison to spontaneous revertants would be  \\nconsidered positive.  \\n(ii)     \\nIn-vitro Cytogenetic Assay: \\n The desired level of toxicity for in-vitro  \\ncytogenetic tests using cell lines should be greater than 50% reduction in cell  \\nnumber or culture confluency. For lymphocyte cultures, an inhibition of mitotic  \\nindex by greater than 50% is considered sufficient. It should be performed in  \\nCHO cells or on human lymphocyte in culture. In-vitro exposure (with and  \\nwithout metabolic activation, S9 mix) should be done using a minimum of 3 log  \\ndoses. \"Solvent\" and \"positive\" control should be included. A positive control  \\nlike Cyclophosphamide with metabolic activation and Mitomycin C for without  \\nmetabolic activation should be used to give a reproducible and detectable  \\nincrease clastogenic effect over the background which demonstrates the  \\nsensitivity of the test system. Each set should consist of at least three replicates.  \\nIncreased number of aberrations in meta Phase chromosomes should be used as  \\nthe criteria for evaluation.  \\n(iii)     \\nIn-vivo Micronucleus Assay: \\n One rodent species (preferably mouse) is  \\nneeded. Route of administration of test substance should be the same as  \\nintended for humans. Five animals per sex per dose groups should be used. At  \\nleast three dose levels, plus \"solvent\" and \"positive\" control should be tested. A  \\npositive control like mitomycin C or cyclophosphamide should be used. Dosing  \\nshould be done on day 1 and 2 of study followed by sacrifice of animals 6 hours  \\nafter the last injection. Bone marrow from both the femora should be taken out,  \\nflushed with fetal bovine serum (20 min.), pelletted and smeared on glass slides.  \\nGiemsa-MayGruenwald staining should be done and increased number of  \\nmicronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (minimum 1000) should be used as  \\nthe evaluation criteria.  \\n(iv)     \\nIn-vivo Cytogenetic Assay: \\n One rodent species (preferably rat) is to be  \\nused. Route of administration of test substance should be the same as intended  \\nfor humans. Five animals/sex/dose groups should be used. At least three dose  \\nlevels, plus \"solvent\\' and \"Positive\" control should be tested. Positive control  \\nmay include cyclophosphamide. Dosing should be done on day I followed by  \\nintra-peritoneal colchicine administration at 22 hours. Animals should besacrificed 2 hours after colchicine administration. Bone marrow from both the  \\nfemora should be taken out, flushed with hypotonic saline (20 min.), pelletted  \\nand resuspended in Carnoy\\'s fluid. Once again the cells should be pelletted and  \\ndropped on clean glass slides with a Pasteur pipette. Giemsa staining should be  \\ndone and increased number of aberrations in metaphase chromosomes  \\n(minimum 100) should be used as the evaluation criteria.  \\n1.7 Carcinogenicity (See Appendix 1, Item 4.8)  \\nCarcinogenicity studies should be performed for all drugs that are expected to  \\nbe clinically used for more than 6 months as well as for drugs used frequently in  \\nan intermittent manner in the treatment of chronic or recurrent conditions.  \\nCarcinogenicity studies are also to be performed for drugs if there is concern  \\nabout their carcinogenic potential emanating from previous demonstration of  \\ncarcinogenic potential in the product class that is considered relevant to humans  \\nor where structure-activity relationship suggests carcinogenic risk or when there  \\nis evidence of preneoplastic lesions in repeated dose toxicity studies or when  \\nlong-term tissue retention of parent compound or metabolite(s) results in local  \\ntissue reactions or other pathophysiological responses. For pharmaceuticals  \\ndeveloped to treat certain serious diseases, Licensing Authority may allow  \\ncarcinogenicity testing to be conducted after marketing permission has been  \\ngranted.  \\nIn instances where the life-expectancy in the indicated population is short  \\n(i.e., \\n less than 2-3 years) - no long-term carcinogenicity studies may be  \\nrequired. In cases where the therapeutic agent for cancer is generally successful  \\nand life is significantly prolonged there may be later concerns regarding  \\nsecondary cancers. When such drugs are intended for adjuvant therapy in  \\ntumour free patients or for prolonged use in non-cancer indications,  \\ncarcinogenicity studies may be/are needed. Completed rodent carcinogenicity  \\nstudies are not needed in advance of the conduct of large scale clinical trials,  \\nunless there is special concern for the patient population.  \\nCarcinogenicity studies should be done in a rodent species (preferably rat).  \\nMouse may be employed only with proper scientific justification. The selected  \\nstrain of animals should not have a very high or very low incidence of  \\nspontaneous tumors.At least three dose levels should be used. The highest dose should be sub- \\nlethal, and it should not reduce the life span of animals by more than 10% of  \\nexpected normal. The lowest dose should be comparable to the intended human  \\ntherapeutic dose or a multiple of it,  \\ne.g. \\n 2.5x; to make allowance for the  \\nsensitivity of the species. The intermediate dose is to be placed logarithmically  \\nbetween the other two doses. An untreated control and (if indicated) a vehicle  \\ncontrol group should be included. The drug should be administered 7 days a  \\nweek for a fraction of the life span comparable to the fraction of human life  \\nspan over which the drug is likely to be used therapeutically. Generally, the  \\nperiod of dosing should be 24 months for rats and 18 months for mice.  \\nObservations should include macroscopic changes observed at autopsy and  \\ndetailed histopathology of organs and tissues. Additional tests for  \\ncarcinogenicity (short-term bioassays, neonatal mouse assay or tests employing  \\ntransgenic animals) may also be done depending on their applicability on a case  \\nto case basis.  \\nNote \\n.— \\nEach dose group and concurrent control group not intended to be  \\nsacrificed early should contain at least 50 animals of each sex.

In the early stages of drug development enough  \\ninformation may not be available to rationally select study design for safety  \\nassessment. In such a situation, a general approach to safety pharmacology  \\nstudies can be applied. Safety pharmacology studies are studies that investigate  \\npotential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of a substance on physiological  \\nfunctions in relation to exposure within the therapeutic range or above.  \\n1.1 Specific Pharmacological ActionsSpecific pharmacological actions are those which demonstrate the therapeutic  \\npotential for humans.  \\nThe specific studies that should be conducted and their design will be different  \\nbased on the individual properties and intended uses of investigational drug.  \\nScientifically validated methods should be used. The use of new technologies  \\nand methodologies in accordance with sound scientific principles should be  \\npreferred.  \\n1.2 General Pharmacological Actions  \\n1.2.1 Essential Safety Pharmacology  \\nSafety pharmacology studies need to be conducted to investigate the  \\npotential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of a substance on physiological  \\nfunctions in relation to exposure within the therapeutic range and above. These  \\nstudies should be designed to identify undesirable pharmacodynamic properties  \\nof a substance that may have relevance to its human safety; to evaluate adverse  \\npharmacodynamic and/or pathophysiological effects observed in toxicology  \\nand/or clinical studies; and to investigate the mechanism of the adverse  \\npharmacodynamic effects observed and/or suspected.  \\nThe aim of the essential safety pharmacology is to study the effects of the  \\ntest drug on vital functions. Vital organ systems such as cardiovascular,  \\nrespiratory and central nervous systems should be studied. Essential safety  \\npharmacology studies may be excluded or supplemented based on scientific  \\nrationale. Also, the exclusion of certain test(s) or exploration(s) of certain  \\norgans, systems or functions should be scientifically justified.  \\n1.2.1.1    Cardiovascular System  \\nEffects of the investigational drug should be studied on blood pressure, heart  \\nrate and the electrocardiogram. If possible in-vitro, in-vivo and/or ex-vivo  \\nmethods including electrophysiology should also be considered.  \\n1.2.1.2    Central Nervous SystemEffects of the investigational drug should be studied on motor activity,  \\nbehavioural changes, coordination, sensory and motor reflex responses and  \\nbody temperature.  \\n1.2.1.3    Respiratory System  \\nEffects of the investigational drug on respiratory rate and other functions  \\nsuch as tidal volume and haemoglobin oxygen saturation should be studied.  \\n1.3 Follow-up and Supplemental Safety Pharmacology Studies  \\nIn addition to the essential safety pharmacological studies, additional  \\nsupplemental and follow-up safety pharmacology studies may need to be  \\nconducted as appropriate. These depend on the pharmacological properties or  \\nchemical class of the test substance, and the data generated from safety  \\npharmacology studies, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, experimental in-vitro  \\nor in-vivo studies, or from literature reports.  \\n1.3.1 Follow-up Studies for Essential Safety Pharmacology  \\nFollow-up studies provide additional information or a better understanding  \\nthan that provided by the essential safety pharmacology.  \\n1.3.1.1    Cardiovascular System  \\nThese include ventricular contractility, vascular resistance and the  \\neffects of chemical mediators, their agonists and antagonists on the  \\ncardiovascular system.  \\n1.3.1.2    Central Nervous System  \\nThese include behavioural studies, learning and memory,  \\nelectrophysiology studies, neurochemistry and ligand binding  \\nstudies.  \\n1.3.1.3 Respiratory System  \\nThese include airway resistance, compliance, pulmonary arterial  \\npressure, blood gases and blood pH.1.3.2 Supplemental Safety Pharmacology Studies  \\nThese studies are required to investigate the possible adverse  \\npharmacological effects that are not assessed in the essential safety  \\npharmacological studies and are a cause for concern.  \\n1.3.2.1    Urinary System  \\nThese include urine volume, specific gravity, osmolality, pH,  \\nproteins, cytology and blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and plasma  \\nproteins estimation.  \\n1.3.2.2    Autonomic Nervous System  \\nThese include binding to receptors relevant for the autonomic  \\nnervous system, and functional response to agonist or antagonist  \\nresponses in-vivo or in-vitro, and effects of direct stimulation of  \\nautonomic nerves and their effects on cardiovascular responses.  \\n1.3.2.3    Gastrointestinal System  \\nThese  \\ninclude  \\nstudies  \\non  \\ngastric  \\nsecretion,  \\ngastric  \\npH  \\nmeasurement, gastric mucosal examination, bile secretion, gastric  \\nemptying time in-vivo and ileocaecal contraction in-vitro.  \\n1.3.2.4    Other Organ Systems  \\nEffects of the investigational drug on organ systems not  \\ninvestigated elsewhere should be assessed when there is a cause for  \\nconcern. For example dependency potential, skeletal muscle,  \\nimmune and endocrine functions may be investigated.  \\n1.4     \\nConditions under which Safety Pharmacology Studies are not necessary  \\nSafety pharmacology studies are usually not required for locally applied  \\nagents  \\ne.g. \\n dermal or ocular, in cases when the pharmacology of the  \\ninvestigational drug is well known, and/or when systemic absorption from the  \\nsite of application is low. Safety pharmacology testing is also not necessary, in  \\nthe case of a new derivative having similar pharmacokinetics and  \\npharmacodynamics.1.5     \\nTiming of Safety Pharmacology Studies in relation to Clinical  \\nDevelopment  \\n1.5.1    Prior to First Administration in Humans  \\nThe effects of an investigational drug on the vital functions listed in the  \\nessential safety pharmacology should be studied prior to first  \\nadministration in humans. Any follow-up or supplemental studies  \\nidentified, should be conducted if necessary, based on a cause for  \\nconcern.  \\n1.5.2    During Clinical Development  \\nAdditional investigations may be warranted to clarify observed or  \\nsuspected adverse effects in animals and humans during clinical  \\ndevelopment.  \\n1.5.3    Before applying for marketing approval  \\nFollow-up and supplemental safety pharmacology studies should be  \\nassessed prior to approval unless not required, in which case this should  \\nbe justified. Available information from toxicology studies addressing  \\nsafety pharmacology endpoints or information from clinical studies can  \\nreplace such studies.  \\n1.6  \\nApplication of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) \\n  \\nThe animal studies be conducted in an accredited laboratory. Where the  \\nsafety pharmacology studies are part of toxicology studies, these studies should  \\nalso be conducted in an accredited laboratory.  \\nAPPENDIX V   \\nINFORMED CONSENT \\n  \\n1.

FDCs can be divided into the  \\nfollowing groups and data required for approval for marketing is described  \\nbelow:  \\n(a)    The first group of FDCs includes those in which one or more of the active  \\ningredients is a new drug. For such FDCs to be approved for marketing  \\ndata to be submitted will be similar to data required for any new drug  \\n(including clinical trials)  \\n[See \\n Rule 122E, item (a)].  \\n(b)    (i) The second group FDCs includes those in which active ingredients  \\nalready approved/ marketed individually are combined for the first time,  \\nfor a particular claim and where the ingredients are likely to have  \\nsignificant interaction of a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic nature  \\n[See Rule 122-E, item (c)]. If clinical trials have been carried out with the  \\nFDC in other countries, reports of such trials should be submitted. If the  \\nFDC is marketed abroad, the regulatory status in other countries should be  \\nstated (See Appendix 1, Item 9).  \\n(ii)    For marketing permission, appropriate chemical and pharmaceutical  \\ndata will be submitted. In case such a combination is not marketed  \\nanywhere in the world but these drugs are already in use concomitantly  \\n(not as an FDC but individually) for the said claim, marketing permission  \\nmay be granted based on chemical and pharmaceutical data. Data showing  \\nthe stability of the proposed dosage form will also have to be submitted.  \\n(iii)    For any other such FDCs, clinical trials may be required. For  \\nobtaining permission to carry out clinical trials with such FDCs a summary  \\nof available pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data on the  \\nindividual ingredients should be submitted, along with the rationale for  \\ncombining them in the proposed ratio. In addition, acute toxicity data (LD  \\n50) and pharmacological data should be submitted on the individual  \\ningredients as well as their combination in the proposed ratio.(c)    The third group of FDCs includes those which are already marketed, but in  \\nwhich it is proposed either to change the ratio of active ingredients or to  \\nmake a new therapeutic claim. For such FDCs, the appropriate rationale  \\nincluding published reports (if any) should be submitted to obtain  \\nmarketing permission. Permission will be granted depending upon the  \\nnature of the claim and data submitted.  \\n(d)    The fourth group of FDC includes those whose individual active  \\ningredients (or drugs from the same class) have been widely used in a  \\nparticular indication(s) for years, their concomitant use is often necessary  \\nand no claim is proposed to be made other than convenience. It will have  \\nto be demonstrated that the proposed dosage form is stable and the  \\ningredients  \\nare  \\nunlikely  \\nto  \\nhave  \\nsignificant  \\ninteraction  \\nof  \\na  \\npharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic nature.  \\nNo additional animal or human data are generally required for these FDCs,  \\nand marketing permission may be granted if the FDC has an acceptable  \\nrationale.  \\nAPPENDIX VII   \\nUNDERTAKING BY THE INVESTIGATOR \\n  \\n1.

In case of formulations the testing  \\nshould cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and  \\nmicrobiological attributes, preservative content  \\n(e.g., \\n antioxidant, antimicrobial  \\npreservative), and functionality tests  \\n(e.g., \\n for a dose delivery system).  \\nValidated stability indicating analytical procedures should be applied. For  \\nlong-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the  \\nstability profile of the drug substance.In general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions  \\nthat test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The  \\nstorage conditions and the length of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover  \\nstorage, shipment and subsequent use.  \\nStress testing of the drug substance should be conducted to identify the  \\nlikely degradation products, which in turn establish the degradation pathways,  \\nevaluate the intrinsic stability of the molecule and validate the stability  \\nindicating power of the analytical procedures used. The nature of the stress  \\ntesting will depend on the individual drug substance and the type of formulation  \\ninvolved.  \\nStress testing may generally be carried out on a single batch of the drug  \\nsubstance. It should include the effect of temperature(s), humidity where  \\nappropriate, oxidation and photolysis on the drug substance.  \\nData should be provided for (a) Photostability on at least one primary batch  \\nof the drug substance as well as the formulation, as the case may be, and (b) the  \\nsusceptibility of the drug substance to hydrolysis across a wide range of pH  \\nvalues when in solution or suspension.  \\nLong-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months\\' duration on at  \\nleast three primary batches of the drug substance or the formulation at the time  \\nof submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover  \\nthe proposed shelf life. Accelerated testing should cover a minimum of 6  \\nmonths duration at the time of submission.  \\nIn case of drug substances, the batches should be manufactured to a  \\nminimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route and using a method of  \\nmanufacture that simulates the final process to be used for production batches.  \\nIn case of formulations, two of the three batches should be at least pilot scale  \\nand the third one may be smaller. The manufacturing process(es) used for  \\nprimary batches should simulate that to be applied to production batches and  \\nshould provide products of the same quality and meeting the same  \\nspecifications as that intended for marketing.  \\nThe stability studies for drug substances should be conducted either in the  \\nsame container-closure system as proposed for storage and distribution or in a  \\ncontainer-closure system that simulates the proposed final packaging. In case offormulations, the stability studies should be conducted in the final container- \\nclosure system proposed for marketing.  \\nStability testing of new drug substances and formulations: \\n  \\n(i) Study conditions for drug substances and formulations intended to be stored  \\nunder general conditions  \\nStudy  \\nStudy conditions  \\nDuration of study  \\nLong-term  \\n30° C ± 2° C/65% RH ± 5% RH  \\n12 months  \\nAccelerated  \\n40° C ± 2° C/75% RH ± 5% RH  \\n6 months  \\n\\n  \\nIf at any time during 6 months\\' testing under the accelerated storage  \\ncondition, such changes occur that cause the product to fail in complying with  \\nthe prescribed standards, additional testing under an intermediate storage  \\ncondition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria.  \\n(ii) Study conditions for drug substances and formulations intended to be  \\nstored in a refrigerator  \\n  \\nStudy \\n  \\nStudy conditions \\n  \\nDuration of study \\n  \\nLong-term  \\n5° C ± 3° C  \\n12 months  \\nAccelerated 25° C ± 2° C/60% RH ± 5% RH  \\n6 months  \\n  \\n(iii) Study conditions for drug substances and formulations intended to be stored  \\nin a freezer  \\n  \\n  \\n(iv)    Drug substances intended for storage below -20° C shall be treated on a  \\ncase-by-case basis.  \\nStudy \\n  \\nStudy conditions \\n  \\nDuration of study \\n  \\nStudy  \\nStudy conditions  \\nDuration of study  \\nLong-term  \\n-20° C° ± 5° C  \\n12 months(v)    Stability testing of the formulation after constitution or dilution, if  \\napplicable, should be conducted to provide information for the labelling on the  \\npreparation, storage condition, and in-use period of the constituted or diluted  \\nproduct.
